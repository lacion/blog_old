My name is Luis Morales; I’m a lifelong programmer, site reliability engineer, DevOps, and maker, and as of 2011, a parent as well. I work out of my home office in Madrid, Spain. This is my blog. There are many like it — infrequently updated, lacking direction, occasionally entertaining — I hope you enjoy it.

Here are some links to pages about me:

### Background.

I am a Senior DevOps Engineer @ ZincIO. Before ZincIO I worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at DroneDeploy, speaking, writing, consulting, and very much not getting rich during Web 1.0, I worked on a bunch of web sites you haven't heard of.
