My name is Luis Morales; I’m a lifelong programmer, site reliability engineer, and maker, and as of 2011, a parent as well. I work out of my home office in Madrid, Spain. This is my blog. There are many like it — infrequently updated, lacking direction, occasionally entertaining — I hope you enjoy it.

Here are some links to pages about me:

* [lacion@github](https://github.com/lacion) — my public projects on GitHub

* [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luismmorales/) — my professional profile

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lacion/) — some of my aerial photography and videos

### Background.

I am a Site Reliability Engineer @ DroneDeploy have been for 3+ years now. Before DroneDeploy I worked as a DevOps Engineer at Location Labs (by Avast), speaking, writing, consulting, and very much not getting rich during Web 1.0, I worked on a bunch of web sites you haven't heard of.
